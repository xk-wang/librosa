# Librosa

Librosa is a c++ implemention of librosa using Eigen

# About
similar with librosa, you can just use a single header [librosa.h](https://github.com/ewan-xu/LibrosaCpp/blob/main/librosa/librosa.h) to compute short-time fourier transform coefficients, mel spectrogram, mfcc and constant Q tranform. This project is base on https://github.com/ewan-xu/LibrosaCpp/.

# TODO
- fully support resampling like librosa
- other interesting issues.
